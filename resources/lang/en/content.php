Other techniques by which humans modify food organisms include selective breeding (plant breeding and animal breeding), and somaclonal variation.

    GMO
    A genetically modified organism (GMO) or genetically engineered organism (GEO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques.

The performance and completion of this duty towards Allah (s.w.t.) has the highest priority for a Muslim. That is why all actions are carried out in such a way that any possible and/or anticipated mistake must/can be avoided altogether.

    A recognised Islamic institutional authority should take all responsibilities for halal certification services.

    The institution itself nominates competent persons, who supervise and conduct audit of the factory, the production sites, and production lines as well as monitoring all incoming raw materials periodically, as required.

    The product, the production line and/or factory must be supervised, audited and a rapport is furnished by the competent auditors of the institutional authority certifying (i.e. the Islamic Centre, a mosque). The certifying authority issues the requested “halal certificate,” after studying and discussing the rapport of Auditor, when all necessary halal requirements are fulfilled. Halal Certificate is a religious verdict (Fatwa).

    A Halal certificate must always accompany all animal raw materials. This halal certificate should be issued to slaughterhouse, at the spot, on the request of a responsible for such a product by a local Islamic institutional authority (an Islamic Centre or a mosque), which is authorized and legalized accordingly.

    For the production of pure and halal food products (for new production factory) a Halal conforming production line should be installed accordingly. A complete separation of the Halal line or a separation of some parts of the factory is necessary to cope with the requirements depending on the situation. The line should be audited and certified periodically through a competent person from an authorized Islamic institutional office.

    The quality, safety and hygiene conditions of production processes should be kept strictly controlled. Any cross-contamination should be strictly avoided.

    Halal production possibilities:
    The summary of the above, allows the following conclusion:

    The entire factory can be changed to halal production;
    A part of the factory can be changed for halal production (the inspection and control in both situations should be executed by a qualified and authorised person);

    The slaughter must take place in the name of Allah (s.w.t.).
    During the slaughtering process, the neck arteries, veins and the trachea of the animal must be cut through. Whole Blood must flow out. The neck (spinal cord) should not be cut through before removing the skin and opening the bally.
    Every sane practising Muslim whoever understands Islamic law and follows it, can perform the slaughtering; is trained for the process, and is able to execute it in the proper manner, is free to do so.

        Halal is a whole concept. If we want to understand its implementation in the different aspects of life, we would realize that it often goes beyond our common understanding of Halal.

        For example if we look into Meat. Everybody knows that only Meat of an animal, which is slaughtered according to the Shariah rulings is considered Halal. Besides that he should also belong to the category of permitted animals.

        But going deeper, we realize that only an animal, which is feed properly, meaning with permissible and non-hazardous components, shall be considered for Halal slaughtering.

        Halal certification is a voluntary certification attesting any product to be compliant with the Islamic shariah laws.

            With the review of the products, the ingredients, the preparation, the storage and the processing, the hygiene and sanitation procedures by our experts, the whole manufacturing undergoes a thorough process of inspection and verification. The confidentiality is naturally maintained.
            Once a product meet our standards a halal certificate is issued. Once the product is certified, permission is granted to display the HCS certification logo, on the product packaging and label. This is a valuable assurance that the product is an authentic HCS halal-certified product meeting the highest quality of halal certification available anywhere in the world.

            Summarizing, one can say, the benefits are:
            Tapping into a quarter of world’s population provides a lucrative export opportunity for any producer to the global Halal market. With a total global Muslim population of nearly 1.8 billion, the Halal market is currently estimated to be worth approximately US$300 billion.
            Since Halal certification is not mandatory, a competitive advantage is gained over companies with no Halal compliance.

            The overwhelming response by the responsible teaching staff and the students, has encouraged us to continously enhance and upgrade our educational training programme.

            Our training module offers the students an overview on the basic requirements of the halal food production and enables them to understand the implementation of the standard in the food industry.

            Starting off with a basic definition of halal and haram and the relevant references in Qur'an and Sunnah, we elaborate which preconditions a raw material should fulfill. Apart from that we discuss the requirments for the procurement and storage of the raw materials, their production, labelling and transport of the finished product.

            These students are valuable assets for the future halal industry, as enabling them to understand the key elements of halal production will help the industry to learn from their knowledge and work effectively towards implementation of the halal standards.
